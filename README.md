# wsprnet_api - Documentation for using the API

At this point in time the API is invite only. Please send me a note if you want to be included. There are some infrastructure concerns that we need  to deal with before we open this up.

# Good citizenship
- Do not request the same query more frequently than every 2 minutes.
- Avoid the 2 minute boundaries, since that's when the user uploads all hit, and the server is busiest.
- Always take the minimal amount data you need.
- If you want a full feed of every spot **DO NOT USE THIS API**. We  will work directly with sites for peering arrangements, so please reach out to the admins.

# Endpoints
Three endpoints are provided:

* `https://www.wsprnet.org/drupal/wsprnet/spots/json`
* `https://www.wsprnet.org/drupal/wsprnet/paths/json`
* `https://www.wsprnet.org/drupal/wsprnet/status/json`

- **spots** - Returns all spots, unsummarized.
- **paths** - Returns one spot per `Call`, `Reporter`, `Call Grid`, `Reporter Grid`. This is exactly what the map query renders.
- **status** - Stations occasionally upload their status, which includes band and TX %. This API returns the recent statuses.

# API Parameters
The following table shows the parameters enabled on a specific endpoint. Parameters can be passed via GET or POST. All parameters are optional, but please note the values in parentheses are defaults.

| Endpoint | spotnum_start | band (30m) | minutes (4) | callsign | reporter | exclude_special (1) |
| ---------| :-----------: | :--: | :-----: | :------: | :------: | :-------------: |
| wsprnet/spots/json| X | X | X | X | X| X |
| wsprnet/paths/json |   | X | X | X | | X |
| wsprnet/status/json |   | X | X | X | | X |

- **spotnum_start** - each Spot gets a Unique ID. The API returns spots **greater than** the passed value.
- **band** - see 'Band Values' below
- **minutes** - number of minutes to retrieve. 24 hours of Spots are available from this API. Should be an even number<sup>1</sup>.
- **callsign** - filters by the Transmitting Station's call sign.
- **reporter** - filters by the Reporting Station's call sign<sup>2</sup>.
- **exclude_special** - 0 or 1. Excludes balloon station telemetry call signs.

<sup>1</sup> Spots are timestamped with the __start__ of the 2 minute cycle they were decoded, i.e. xx:00, xx:02 etc. So at any instant the database will be populated with spots from 2 cycles back, i.e. -4 minutes from the current time.

<sup>2</sup> When the Call and Reporter call signs are identical, then the results will include Spots where Call **or** Reporter match; otherwise, it's where Call **and**  Reporter match.

# Band Values
Note: The WSPRNet ingress process takes the reported frequency and applies `Math.floor()` then stores the resultant integer in the `band` field (unless the reported frequency is less than `0.25 Mhz` (LF), which is recorded as `-1`). So any missing band(s) in the list can still be retrieved. However, we appreciate PRs to keep list up to date.
| Band | `band` parameter |
| :--: | ---------------- |
| -1 | LF|
| 0 | MF |
| 1 | 160m |
| 3 | 80m |
| 5 | 60m |
| 7 | 40m |
| 10| 30m |
| 14 | 20m|
| 18 | 17m|
| 21 | 15m|
|	 24 | 12m|
| 28 | 10m|
| 40 | 8m|
| 50 | 6m|
| 70 | 4m|
| 144 | 2m|
| 432 | 70cm|
| 1296 | 23cm|
| All | All bands |

# Modes (code field)
The Mode being used on WSJT-x is stored in the `code` field. It decodes as follows:
  | Code | Mode |
  | :--: | ----------- |
  | -1   | Unknown |
  | 1    | WSPR-2     |
  | 2    | FST4W-900 / WSPR-15 |
  | 3    | FST4W-120   |
  | 4    | FST4W-300 |
  | 8    | FST4W-1800 |
